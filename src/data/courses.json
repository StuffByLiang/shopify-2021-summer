The attempt to frame a distinction between appearance and reality has always been a major preoccupation in social, political, philosophical, and literary works, leaving some to question whether ultimate reality is fated to lie beyond our grasp, others to wonder whether there is some way to access reality through appearance, and still others to question or reject the distinction entirely. This course explores the nature and challenges of the appearance/reality distinction via a diverse literature of ancient, modern, and postmodern works. While the idea that \u001cthings are not always as they seem\u001d is a very old notion, it has never been more timely, as social media has greatly amplified the power to disseminate views driven by personal values, and opinions packaged as irrefutable fact. In a world permeated by allegations of \u001cfake news\u001d and allusions to \u001cvirtual reality,\u001d and where once venerable grand theories can look like little more than competing and self-serving stories, sustained reflection on the validity, salience, and evolving forms of the appearance/reality distinction beckons.\n\nIf, when the lecture is full, you would like to be placed on a waitlist for this course email: arts.fyp@ubc.ca","Choose one section from all 2 activity types.

We will assess the factors that make tropical systems both unique but also vulnerable to degradation, drawing from comparisons across geographic regions. While we learn about the structure, function and biological history of the tropics, we will address the myriad challenges these regions face in biodiversity loss and conservation practice. \nThis course is best suited for 3rd or 4th year students with a basic background in ecology, evolution and geography. Each week, we will introduce a course theme with a lecture, to provide a sound conceptual foundation, followed by discussion based on studies in the primary literature. Students are expected to read, evaluate and discuss scientific literature relevant to these course topics.\n\nFor more information please contact Jill Jankowski at jankowsk@biodiversity.ubc.ca.","Choose one section from all 2 activity types.
